# Advanced Computing Workshop, UIBE-SITE 2019

This is a workshop hosted by [School of International Trade and Economics (SITE)](http://site.uibe.edu.cn/) in 2019's summer. It intends to provide training in computing-related programming for teachers as well as undergraduates.

## Main Topics

- Python Parallel Computing

  As a workhorse of data science, python provides multiple ways to perform parallel computing. There are also constantly updating parallel computing means provided by open-source packages.

  In the aspect of parallel computing, the workshop focuses on implementation via Python and IPython. As a supplement, some frequently used Linux commands will be introduced in case that you perform your tasks in Linux environment.

  This topic covers:

  1. **Beyond Plain Python**. 
  Introducing tricks while using IPython and commands frequently used in Linux.
  2. **Multi-Treading in Python**. 
  Introducing Python's multi-threading classes, as well as communication mechanisms between threads.
  3. **Parallel Computing with Multiple Cores and Cluster Computing**.
  Introducing multicore programming, asynchronous calling mechanisms in Python
